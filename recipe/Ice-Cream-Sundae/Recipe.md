 Keep the ice cream in the freezer until right before you're ready to construct the sundae. If you're using non-fruit sauces, like butterscotch or hot fudge, zap them for a few seconds in the microwave to warm them up.

 Next, ladle 2 ounces sauce into the bottom of the dish. Drop in 2 generous scoops of the vanilla ice cream on top of the sauce. Top with another 2 ounces sauce. Drop in the final scoop of ice cream. Pour the remainder of the sauce over the sundae. Top with whipped cream and the garnish of your choice.
